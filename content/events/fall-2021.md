  - title: 'On Being An Early Career Dev In Your 30s'
    abstract: 'Being early in your career always presents unique challenges, while being early in your second career later in life has its own particular issues to grapple with. The typical pipeline for the software industry does not fit the paradigm of an older career changer, and their presence can often throw the system for a loop. In this talk, we will cover practical steps for navigating specific challenges related to hiring and being hired as a second-career dev. If approached with intention and thoughtfulness, the benefits can be immense for all involved.'

  - title: 'Early Career Negotiation: You’re Not As Powerless As They Want You To Feel'
    abstract: 'Early in your career in technology it often feels like you need to take anything that’s given. And many employers want juniors to believe they don’t have any leverage to negotiate. Together, we’ll explore what kinds of negotiations are common in your early career and look at how you can begin to build out information to better inform these exchanges. We’ll also look at how you can use these experiences to help inform your choices as you gain more experience in tech.'
