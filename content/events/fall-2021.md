    title: 'On Being An Early Career Dev In Your 30s'
    type: content
    abstract: 'Being early in your career always presents unique challenges, while being early in your second career later in life has its own particular issues to grapple with. The typical pipeline for the software industry does not fit the paradigm of an older career changer, and their presence can often throw the system for a loop. In this talk, we will cover practical steps for navigating specific challenges related to hiring and being hired as a second-career dev. If approached with intention and thoughtfulness, the benefits can be immense for all involved.'

    title: 'Early Career Negotiation: You’re Not As Powerless As They Want You To Feel'
    type: content
    abstract: 'Early in your career in technology it often feels like you need to take anything that’s given. And many employers want juniors to believe they don’t have any leverage to negotiate. Together, we’ll explore what kinds of negotiations are common in your early career and look at how you can begin to build out information to better inform these exchanges. We’ll also look at how you can use these experiences to help inform your choices as you gain more experience in tech.'

    title: When and How to Say No
    type: content
    abstract: It can often feel like every day there is a new ask of us - people asking for our time, effort, or knowledge. While many of these requests represent great opportunities for career growth, income or a warm fuzzy feeling, it is impossible to say how to decide whether something is right for you as well as some helpful advice for when and how to say no.
