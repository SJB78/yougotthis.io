  - content: <p>Unlike our other events which have talks or workshops, this chill ebd-of-year event will be focused on meeting others, socialising and having fun.</p><p class="mt-4">For the first part of the night you will get to meet others in a series of small video calls, followed by a group game, and back to smaller groups to wrap up the evening. There will be giveaways, cheesy Christmas music, and a chance to form new friendships.</p>
