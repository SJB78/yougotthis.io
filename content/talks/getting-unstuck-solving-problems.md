  title: Getting Unstuck and Solving Problems
  abstract: All software engineers get stuck - whether you're brand new or have 20 years experience. In this session, we’ll reframe the act of getting stuck as a positive. Then we’ll talk about strategies for getting past a tricky problem. We’ll discuss the psychology behind these strategies, and answer questions like “Why do my best ideas come to me in the shower?” Finally, we’ll look at ways to harden yourself for the next time you get stuck.

    bio: Steven Hicks is a Senior Engineer at Artsy. He loves JavaScript and specializes as a generalist. Steve believes that code is written for humans, and that if you ain't falling, you ain't learning. When he isn't talking to the duck or smooshing 1s and 0s, you can find Steve outside -- probably camping with his family, running trails, or riding his bike.
