  title: How and When To Say No
  abstract: "It can often feel like every day there is a new ask of us - people asking for our time, effort, or knowledge. While many of these requests represent great opportunities for career growth, income or a warm fuzzy feeling, it is impossible to say yes to everything that comes your way. In this talk weâ€™ll consider how to decide whether something is right for you as well as some helpful advice for when and how to say no."
