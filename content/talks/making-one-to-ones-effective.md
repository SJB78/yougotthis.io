  title: Making Your 1-1s Effective
  abstract: 1-1s are your opportunity to ensure you and your manager are on the same page, to work on your career development, and for you to give and receive feedback. Used effectively, 1-1s help you. However, many managers and reports don't know how to have effective 1-1s. In this talk you will learn how to use 1-1s as the supportive tool they are meant to be.
