          I attend a high volume of developer events and can say without
          reservation that You Got This is one of the most welcoming and
          meaningfully educational events I've ever been to. I strongly
          recommend it not just to juniors in tech, but to managers and leads
          wanting better insight into how to support their teams.

          The speakers and their talks were amazing and showcased immense
          diversity. The organisers do an amazing job of making everyone feel
          like they belong and make the extra effort to make sure that everyone
          is included. It's my favourite tech conference on the calendar and I
          can't wait for the next one.

          There haven't been many events like You Got This. It is easily one of
          my favourite conferences out there! I leave every single one with
          practical insights on how to make sure that I have a better
          relationship with my tech career, new friends and looking for the sign
          up link for the next one. Thank you to the team for creating such a
          safe and wonderful space for everyone!

          You Got This is an achievement of conference curation - where every
          talk not only fit within the theme and served the audience's
          expectations, but built off of one enough and made the event seem like
          one coherent performance. Over the years YGT has grown an incredible
          and supportive community, and is run to a high standard of polish by
          the team.
